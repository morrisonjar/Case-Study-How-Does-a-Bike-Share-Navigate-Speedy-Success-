# Case-Study-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success-

This is my first github README. This case study in particular comes from the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) 
course on Coursera. The final portion of this course was a capstone project containing a choice between three case studies. The case study is to show the skills that 
students have learned throughout the course and apply them by creating a data analysis study. The course itself covered multiple programs to handle data and data 
visualization. These include Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R. With R you can both handle the data and visualize it however, to test my knowledge I attempted to use all the 
material the course has taught me. The exception to this being Excel as Google Sheets could not handle the size of the data that was being used. Instead, I used 
[Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) for the data preparation and R for the rest of the analysis
and visualizations. Tableau was used as well for not only visual purposes, but to compare the tables created through R. The tables I created here can also be seen using 
the [Tableau platform](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jared.morrison/viz/CaseStudyCyclistBike-Share/BikeData#1) or through [Medium]().
